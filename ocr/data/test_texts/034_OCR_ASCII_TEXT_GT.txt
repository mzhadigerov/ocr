1 INTRODUCTION
For the latter, an image retrieval system called DIVER (Document Image ViEwing and Retrieval) was implemented allowing the user to search for keywords in images taken with a camera. The system presents all images in which the keyword was found and highlights the position of all occurrences.
To realize these applications, information has to be extracted from the document images delivered by camera-based document capture. Despite the advantages of digital cameras concerning the usability and all technical advances, the extraction of document content from the images delivered by them is not as easy yet as for the output of a flatbed scanner. Rather, it is a hard problem for several reasons.
First of all, it can be difficult to detect the document in the image, if no constraints in the background are defined. This can e.g. be observed in Figure 1(c).
Furthermore, resolution is still significantly lower than for flatbed scanners - for typical consumer cameras about 4-6 megapixels can be assumed, and large parts of the image are often wasted with background. In contrast to this, a flatbed scanner at the standard resolution of 300 dpi produces 8 — 9 megapixels of information for usual documents (DIN A4). Illumination may also vary over the paper surface, making the separation of text from the background difficult.
Another important problem is that the observed document can be warped in the image. When flatbed scanning, where documents are flattened by manual pressing, textlines in the image are parallel, and only one global rotation has to be estimated. This is not true for camera images of documents, as can be observed in Figures 2 and 3. For flat documents, linear warping occurs if the camera is not exactly perpendicular to the paper surface: when projected to the image, a rectangular sheet of paper adapts a quadrilateral form. Textlines may not be parallel any more -see Figure 2 for a typical example.
